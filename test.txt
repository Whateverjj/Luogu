Confucius first proposed in China's history that people's talents and qualities are similar, and the difference in personality is mainly due to the influence of acquired education and social environment, that is, " By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart. " Thus everyone can be educated, and everyone should be educated. He advocated "teaching without class", founding private schools, recruiting students widely, broke the monopoly of slave-owners and nobles on school education, expanded the scope of education to civilians, and followed the trend of social development at that time. The main content of Confucius moral education is "ritual" and "benevolence". Among them, "rite" is the moral code, and "benevolence" is the highest moral code. "Ritual" is the form of "benevolence". "Benevolence" is the content of "rites". Only with the spirit of "benevolence" can "rites" be truly fulfilled. In terms of moral cultivation, he put forward methods such as establishing ambition, self-denial, fulfilling oneself, introspection, and courage to change. "Learning by learning" is the leading idea of Confucius teaching thought. While advocating asking questions shamelessly and being open-minded, he emphasizes the combination of learning and thinking, that is, "learning without thinking, then thinking, and not thinking without learning," meanwhile, must also "learn to apply" and apply the learned knowledge to social practice. The educational activities of Confucius not only cultivated many students, but the educational theory he put forward on the basis of practice laid a theoretical foundation for ancient Chinese education.
