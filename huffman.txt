The theatrical release of Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated thriller Tenet has been delayed again.

The film was originally slated for release on Friday, July 17, until a few weeks ago when it was pushed to July 31. 
Now Warner Bros. has set the twisty sci-fi movie for Wednesday, Aug. 12. 
The news comes as much of the U.S. is seeing a spike in coronavirus cases.

"Warner Bros. is committed to bringing Tenet to audiences in theaters, on the big screen, 
when exhibitors are ready and public health officials say it's time," a studio spokesperson said in a statement to EW. 
"In this moment what we need to be is flexible, and we are not treating this as a traditional movie release.
 We are choosing to open the movie mid-week to allow audiences to discover the film in their own time, 
 and we plan to play longer, over an extended play period far beyond the norm, 
 to develop a very different yet successful release strategy."
